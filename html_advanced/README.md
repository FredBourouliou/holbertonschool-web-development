## Learning Objectives

2. **Banner** - Hero section with call-to-action
3. **Quote** - Testimonial section
4. **Videos** - Tutorial videos showcase
5. **Membership** - Membership benefits section
6. **FAQ** - Frequently asked questions
7. **Footer** - Site information and social links

## Requirements
- Pure HTML only (no CSS, JavaScript, or external libraries)
